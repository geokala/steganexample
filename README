Note that PNG is only partially implemented as the complexity probably doesn't lend it towards a starting example quite so much as a bitmap does.
Other formats are of course feasible- anything lossless should be relatively straight-forward, but anything with lossy compression would be... interesting (though maybe not impossible).
