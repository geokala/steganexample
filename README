Note that PNG is only partially implemented as the complexity probably doesn't lend it towards a starting example quite so much as a bitmap does.
Other formats are of course feasible- anything lossless should be relatively straight-forward, but anything with lossy compression would be... interesting (though maybe not impossible).

Another way of working with PNGs would be to add a custom header containing the data (obfuscated or otherwise).
Standard image viewing programs wouldn't show the data, but it'd still be visible to any program that supported that header.
However, this method would be rather more obvious when, e.g. viewing the file with a hex editor, so would depend on the purpose and the desire for deniability.
